This App allows users to view jokes that they or other users have created. Signed-in users can create new jokes and can edit and delete those jokes that they created. The jokes are structured such that the Setup is visible from the index, and the punchline is only visible after the joke has been clicked on, thereby avoiding any spoilers.

Technologies used:

JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, Bootstrap

Unsolved problems to be fixed in future iterations:

Future iterations will have more coherent and attractive styling. They will also
incorporate a third party API which will allow users to get new jokes and save them to their account.


The project as originally planned would have incorporated a third party API. The process, however, was severely hampered by my becoming violently ill. Problems were generally solved with a three step approach. Check for syntax errors. Look up the issue on the world wide web. Ask a human for help.
